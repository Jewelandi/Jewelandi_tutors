 <p> Albert Einstein once said <b>"IF YOU JUDGE A FISH BY ITS ABILITY TO CLIMB A TREE, IT WILL SPEND ITS WHOLE LIFE THINKING ITS STUPID"</b>. Now Albert Einstein was right becaiuse a fish cannot climb a tree. because it is not a Monkey. Just like the different animals inj the animal kingdom. human beings and their capacity to assimilate are different. At Jewelandy Tutors we use different teaching methods for different personalities and levels of assimilation, we make sure our student gets the best academic and financial education.</p>
